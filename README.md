## 🔭 What I'm currently working on ...

At work, I'm focusing mainly on Elixir and React, with a bit of legacy Ruby code. I build LLM AI functionality into our platform. Recently, I lead a project to build a RAG system that enables asking questions about customer's data. 

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

I'm currently learning Phoenix LiveView to build Frontend's using elixir. I'm also interested in learning and building upon AI Agents, as this is the direction the AI field is taking.

## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on

I want to build some side projects. Some ideas I have are:

- Travel tracking application. The existing applications seem quite limited in functionality. One use-case is to compile a report of all the dates you have been in this country over the several last years. This is very cumbersome and time consuming. 
- Fact-checker AI powered bot. To help combat mis-information related to USA politics. Ground truths can be used from fact checking websites, aggregate information can be gathered from news sources, sentiment can be gathered some social media. This can use an AI Agent to combine this information and produce a hopefully non-biased, very factful check. This can be expensive to run and controversial.
